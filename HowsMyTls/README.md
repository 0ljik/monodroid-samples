How's my TLS?
=============

This sample demonstrates how to make a basic TLS connection using two different classes availbale for Xamarin.Android developers:
* `HttpWebRequest` - doesn't have support of TLSv1.2, maximum  version of supported TLS is 1.0
* `AndroidClientHandler` - allows to establish secure TLSv1.2 connections
